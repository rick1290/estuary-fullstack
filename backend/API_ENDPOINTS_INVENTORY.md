## API Gap Analysis: Frontend Needs vs Backend Reality

### ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED (Frontend can use these now)
1. **Authentication** - All auth endpoints exist
2. **Practitioner Profiles** - Full CRUD with services, reviews, availability
3. **Service Management** - Complete with packages, bundles, sessions
4. **Booking System** - Full lifecycle including reschedule, cancel, video tokens
5. **Payment Processing** - Stripe integration, credits, payouts all ready
6. **Reviews** - Including replies and helpful marking
7. **Notifications** - Full system with settings and unread counts
8. **Streams** - Complete with like/save/comment functionality

### 🔧 PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (Need minor additions)
1. **Service Filtering**
   - Current: Basic filtering exists via query params
   - Missing: Distance-based filtering, format filter (online/in-person)
   - Action: Add filter parameters to existing endpoint

2. **Search System**
   - Current: Basic search on individual endpoints
   - Missing: Unified search endpoint, search suggestions
   - Action: Create new SearchView that queries multiple models

3. **Time Slots**
   - Current: `services/{id}/availability/` exists
   - Missing: Specific time slot format the frontend expects
   - Action: Modify response format or add new endpoint

### ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED (Need to build)
1. **Favorites System**
   - Need: Generic favorites for practitioners and services
   - Action: Create new app or add to users app

2. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Need: Revenue analytics, client analytics, booking trends
   - Action: Create analytics app with aggregation views

3. **Promo Codes**
   - Need: Validate and apply promotional codes
   - Action: Add to payments app

## Quick Verification Script

Create this script to verify all endpoints:

```python
# backend/verify_endpoints.py
import requests
from django.urls import reverse
from rest_framework.test import APIClient

def verify_endpoints():
    """Verify all API endpoints are accessible"""
    client = APIClient()
    
    # List of all endpoints to verify
    endpoints = [
        ('GET', '/api/v1/auth/user/'),
        ('GET', '/api/v1/services/services/'),
        ('GET', '/api/v1/practitioners/practitioners/'),
        # ... add all endpoints
    ]
    
    results = []
    for method, url in endpoints:
        try:
            response = client.generic(method, url)
            results.append({
                'endpoint': url,
                'status': response.status_code,
                'working': response.status_code < 500
            })
        except Exception as e:
            results.append({
                'endpoint': url,
                'status': 'ERROR',
                'error': str(e)
            })
    
    return results
```

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   ```bash
   # Test all existing endpoints
   python manage.py shell
   >>> from verify_endpoints import verify_endpoints
   >>> results = verify_endpoints()
   ```

2. **Quick Wins** (Can do today):
   - Add missing query parameters to existing endpoints
   - Modify response formats where needed
   - Create wrapper views for complex queries

3. **Short-term** (This week):
   - Implement favorites system
   - Add unified search endpoint
   - Create analytics views

4. **Documentation**:
   - Ensure Swagger UI is up-to-date: `/api/v1/docs/`
   - Test each endpoint in Swagger
   - Generate TypeScript types from OpenAPI schema
