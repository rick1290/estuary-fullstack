## Missing or Required APIs

### User Dashboard

1. **User Favorite Practitioners**
   - ❌ No dedicated API for managing favorite practitioners
   - **Current workaround**: Using localStorage
   - **Needed**: `userAddFavoritePractitioner()`, `userRemoveFavoritePractitioner()`

### Practitioner Dashboard

1. **Client Notes**
   - ❌ No API for practitioner notes on clients
   - **Current state**: Using mock data in ClientNotes component
   - **Needed**: CRUD operations for client notes

2. **Client Detail View**
   - ⚠️ Limited client information available
   - **Current state**: Using paginated clients list with filter by user_id
   - **Improvement needed**: Dedicated endpoint for single client details

## API Usage Patterns

### Successful Patterns
1. Using React Query's generated hooks for all API calls
2. Implementing optimistic updates for better UX
3. Proper error handling and loading states
4. Pagination support where available

### Workarounds Implemented
1. **Favorite Practitioners**: Using localStorage as fallback
2. **Client Details**: Filtering paginated list by user_id to get single client
3. **Client Notes**: Mock data only - needs backend implementation

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Favorite Practitioners API**
   - Add endpoints similar to favorite services
   - Allow users to save/unsave practitioners

2. **Create Client Notes API**
   - CRUD operations for practitioner notes on clients
   - Should be private to the practitioner

3. **Add Dedicated Client Detail Endpoint**
   - Single endpoint to get comprehensive client information
   - Include booking history, statistics, and preferences

4. **Consider Adding**
   - Booking reschedule API
   - Bulk operations for bookings
   - Client communication/messaging API

## Summary

The implementation successfully replaced mock data with real API calls for:
- ✅ All user bookings functionality
- ✅ User favorite services
- ✅ Practitioner bookings management
- ✅ Practitioner clients list
- ⚠️ Partial implementation for favorite practitioners (localStorage fallback)
- ❌ Client notes remain as mock data (no API available)

Overall, the core booking and favorites functionality is fully operational with real data.
