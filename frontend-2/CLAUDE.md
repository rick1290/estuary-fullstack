## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Components**: Functional components with TypeScript
- **Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables
- **File Structure**: Co-locate related components and styles
- **Imports**: Absolute imports using @ alias

### State Management Patterns
- **Local State**: useState for component-specific state
- **Global Auth**: Context API for authentication
- **Server State**: Tanstack Query for API data
- **Form State**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Common Patterns
```typescript
// Component with auth check
const { isAuthenticated } = useAuth()
const { openAuthModal } = useAuthModal()

if (!isAuthenticated) {
  openAuthModal({
    defaultTab: "login",
    redirectUrl: currentPath,
    title: "Sign in Required",
    description: "Please sign in to continue"
  })
}

// Consistent layout wrapper
<PractitionerDashboardPageLayout>
  <YourContent />
</PractitionerDashboardPageLayout>

// Service type differentiation
const getBookingFlow = (serviceType: string) => {
  switch(serviceType) {
    case 'session': return <TimeSlotPicker />
    case 'workshop': return <DateSelector />
    case 'course': return <CourseSchedule />
  }
}
```

## API Integration

### Backend Structure
- **Base URL**: Configured via environment variables
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- **API Client**: Auto-generated from OpenAPI schema
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format

### Key Endpoints
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication flows
- `/api/services/*` - Service CRUD operations
- `/api/bookings/*` - Booking management
- `/api/practitioners/*` - Practitioner profiles
- `/api/streams/*` - Content management
- `/api/transactions/*` - Financial operations

## Deployment

### Environment Variables
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=        # Backend API URL
NEXTAUTH_URL=               # App URL for auth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=            # Auth encryption key
DATABASE_URL=               # Database connection
```

### Build & Deploy
- **Build**: `pnpm build`
- **Start**: `pnpm start`
- **Deploy**: Configured for Render.com via render.yaml

## Important Implementation Notes

### Booking System
- **Sessions**: User selects available time slots
- **Workshops**: Fixed dates/times set by practitioner
- **Courses**: Predefined schedule with multiple sessions
- **Confirmation**: Immediate booking confirmation with email

### Financial Flow
1. Customer makes purchase â†’ Payment processed
2. Credits allocated to practitioner (minus commission)
3. Practitioner balance updated in real-time
4. Payout available after minimum threshold
5. Commission rates adjust based on volume tiers

### Content Streams
- **Types**: Article, Video, Audio, Image
- **Access**: Free public content + premium locked content
- **Monetization**: Practitioners can charge for premium access
- **Discovery**: Category filtering, search, recommendations

## Testing & Development

### Local Development
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Key Test Scenarios
1. Complete booking flow for each service type
2. Practitioner onboarding and service creation
3. Financial transactions and payout requests
4. Content creation and premium access
5. Role switching between customer/practitioner views

## Future Considerations
- Real-time messaging implementation
- Video consultation integration
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Mobile app development
- International payment support
- Multi-language support
